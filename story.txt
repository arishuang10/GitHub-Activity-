Once upon a time, a ten-year-old boy named Michael lives in the forest with his two sisters and his mother. 
As the youngest child, Michael listens well to his sisters but constantly felt like he was an outsider. 
Due to the location of his home, he has not yet seen other kids roaming in the woods. 
As he watches his sisters playing dressup games, he wonders what it would be like to play games with other kids like using tree branches as swords in the wood.
Unfornately, a boy can only dream.
